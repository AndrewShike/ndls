to save space, the **buffer** control selects the buffer number using a binary combination of the two toggle keys. here's a truth table:
| | | |
| - | - | - |
| 0 | 0 | buffer 1 |
| 1 | 0 | buffer 2 |
| 0 | 1 | buffer 3 |
| 1 | 1 | buffer 4 |

## 256 grid

yes, the 256 interface has 6 tracks! and double the pattern recorders! lots of keys = lots of stuff
